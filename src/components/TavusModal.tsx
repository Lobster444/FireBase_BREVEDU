Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
        console.log('ðŸš« Ignoring message - modal not ready:', {
          isOpen,
          hasCourse: !!course,
          hasCurrentUser: !!currentUser,
          isTimedOut
        });
```

The issue was in the console.log statement where a closing curly brace `}` was missing. I've added it to properly close the object literal.

The rest of the file appears to be properly balanced with closing brackets. The file now has all required closing brackets for objects, functions, interfaces, and the React component.
